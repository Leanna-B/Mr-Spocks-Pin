    <h2>

       <p>
    <a>There is a philosophical belief in the fictional universe of Star Trek, which is held by Vulcans, named IDIC; Infinite Diversity Infinite Combinations.</a></p>


      <a>IDIC invites the belief that differences in ideas and attitudes are something to delight in rather than fear.
      </a>

      <p><a>The Vulcan character Mr Spock has a pin that represents IDIC. Its basic form is a triangle,  circle and jewel shape, made from different materials, with different textures. As an emblem it symbolizes any two diverse things which come together to create truth or beauty, represented by the jewel in the middle.
      </a>
      </p>

      <p>
     <a>This project is a digital conceptualization of Mr Spock's pin and is an awareness tool that mirrors the larger shared system, reflecting dynamic sensory human data, always in the moment.
     </a>
      </p>

      <p>
         <a>The result is a real-time exploration of  humancentric environtmental data executed through an interactive browser based platform using P5.js and the ML5 library, utilizing a pre-built model called poseNet.

          <p> <a>When people or sounds are picked up within the range of the webcam and microphone, different shapes inspired by Mr Spocks pin, appear on the screen in various sizes, colors, and positions, and respond to human interaction, as much as humans respond to seeing themselves reflected in a novel way.
